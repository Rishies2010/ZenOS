## Current issues in ZenOS

> Executing an elf from the shell other than the same elf itself (init aka shell) crashes the spawner (init), all instances of the spawner.

> Have not yet tested the E1000 driver. It has issues.

> clone_page_directory is showing issues, I think it's actually related to the elf issue.
